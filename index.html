        <p class="lead mb-4">My artistic creativity developed early in my childhood. I used LEGO sets as my main creative outlet growing up. I started small but eventually built high-end sports cars, haunted houses, intricate theme packs, and my favorite, the Millennium Falcon. I have taken art classes in and out of school but did not enjoy the work as much as my creations. I have actually kept up with LEGOs but have wanted to find an alternative creative outlet.

At Amundsen High School, I joined the Career and Technical Education Program which is designed to present students with experiences in various technology fields. While I found the foundations of many programs like HTML and CSS frustrating, once I understood the bone structures, I found coding to be very enjoyable. I started by being able to design a website layout from scratch changing colors, fonts, functions, etc., and have moved quickly into other programs. Coding can be very creative!<br>
<br>
During my junior year e-learning experience, I took web design classes where I learned how to use additional programs and I really took to Photoshop. I worked on many introductory class projects and then found online tutorials which taught me many new tools embedded in Photoshop. I really enjoyed studying these and used many new creative skills for assigned school work. I created all sorts of things from CD/DVD covers, movie posters, school club posters, and magazine covers to birthday and holiday cards, personal brand logos, and even a Georgia “Get Out and Vote” poster.  By working on and creating various projects, I was able to hone my skills and prepare myself for the Adobe Photoshop Associate Certification test. I passed with flying colors, so to speak. My creative journey in technology is just getting going and I want to be able to expand my skills further. 
What I have learned about myself during my four years in high school is that I am very 
dependable. lending a hand is always a generous thing to do. My dependability helped me keep my friends, form trust, and forge deeper relationships with them. When it came to e-learning, a lot of my friends struggled to complete their work due to lack of motivation and burn out. They asked me if I could do study sessions to help them catch up in some classes. Doing this helped them catch up in class, understand the material, and get good grades.
<br>

        <br>After I graduated from highschool I wanted to study the world of business. What has shaped my interest in the field of business is my father who works for Bank of America as a stockbroker. He works day in and day out to provide exceptional service to his clientele. Also, he forms healthy relationships with his co-workers as well. I admire his tenacity and will to work hard. He never gives up when the going gets tough and I respect him for that. Therefore I decided to attend The University of California Riverside because I have heard it had an amazing business program and the college helped students get a job after they graduate
	Currently I am an Undergraduate in The University of California Riverside. I am pursuing a Pre-Business Major. By junior year I hope to get into the School of Business so I can study more in the marketing field. After College my career goals include being able to become a product marketer. It would be cool to be able to run different marketing campaigns for other companies. I could possibly code websites for certain companies and create ads for those companies as well. In my senior year of high school, I have taken a business class, so I have a general idea of different techniques I can use to promote different kinds of businesses, but at the same time, I want to be able to go to college and be able to learn more about business. Ultimately I want to be able to have a positive impact on the lives of others through the products I sell. If I can make other people smile that means I am doing something right.
